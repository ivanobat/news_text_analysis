# Analysis and Classification of fake/true news articles
The term ‘Fake news’ was popularised by Donald Trump in 2016, and is defined as journalism
that contains incorrect or misleading information.

The rise in technology and social media has hugely increased the amount and diversity of news
sources that people have access to, with around 62% of adults in the US consuming news from
social media in 2016, relative to 49% in 2014 (Shu et al, 2017). In addition, the younger
generation tends to rely on social media to educate themselves on political news and world
events (Rubin, 2017).

While access to greater amounts of information is clearly beneficial, this increases the potential
for the propagation of misinformation if the sources are not legitimate, which can have highly
negative real world consequences. For example, misinformation regarding Covid-19 was a
direct cause of lower vaccination rates for certain segments of the population.

To counteract this, identifying fake news is now a great cause of focus for governments and
institutions (Yale Law School, 2017).

Detection of fake news is a highly complex task due to the fact that it is created with the
intention of deceiving the reader. The result of this is that people are almost no better than
random at detecting fake news articles (Zhou 2020, Wang 2017). In addition, the advancement
of AI techniques means that ‘bots’ can create huge quantities of highly realistic content for a low
cost to the actor spreading the fake news (Stahl, 2018), meaning that it is almost impossible for
a human fact checker to solve this detection problem.

Hence, identifying fake news through computational means is a highly relevant and important
topic. In this paper we first discuss and seek to understand and identify differences between
fake and true news articles, and then we build on the techniques used in other literature to
produce a fake news detection classification model.
